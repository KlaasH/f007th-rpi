#### Overview
This project currently contains source code of 2 executables for Raspberry Pi to receive data from temperature/humidity sensors "Ambient Weather F007TH" 
with cheap RF 433MHz receivers like [RXB6](http://www.jmrth.com/en/images/proimages/RXB6_en_v3.pdf), RX-RM-5V, etc.
- **f007th-rpi** is a demo/test program that receive data from sensors and prints it in plain text or JSON format.
- **f007th-rpi_push_to_rest** is more advanced program that sends received and decoded data to a remote server via REST API. 
When it is started with optional argument `--changes-only, -c` it sends data only when the data is actually changed.

#### Arguments of command f007th-rpi_push_to_rest

##### --send-to, -s
Parameter is REST server URL. The server should accept PUT requests.  
Names of fields in JSON are:  
`"time", "valid", "channel", "rolling_code", "temperature", "humidity","battery_ok"`.  
The value of field `temperature` is integer number of dF ("deciFahrenheit" = 1/10 of Fahrenheit). For example, if the value is 724 then the temperature is 72.4&deg;F.   
##### --changes-only, -c
Send only valid and changed data.
##### --log-file, -l
Parameter is a path to log file.
##### --verbose, -v
Verbose output.
##### --more_verbose, -V
More verbose output.

#### How to build
There are several ways to do it. I actually cross-build this project in Eclipse on my Windows machine. 
You can look at [this good instruction about setting up Eclipse for cross-compilation](http://www.cososo.co.uk/2015/12/cross-development-using-eclipse-and-gcc-for-the-rpi/).  

##### Building on Raspberry Pi
- You need to install [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) and [pigpio](http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/index.html) libraries.
```
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo apt-get install pigpio
```
- Clone sources from GitHub. The following command will create new sub-directory f007th-rpi in the current directory and download sources
```
git clone https://github.com/alex-konshin/f007th-rpi.git
```
- Build f007th-rpi
```
cd f007th-rpi
make all
cp f007th-rpi ..
cd ..
```
- Build f007th-rpi
```
cd f007th-rpi_push_to_rest
make all
cp f007th-rpi_push_to_rest ..
cd ..
```
